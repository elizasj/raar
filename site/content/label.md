Two of techno’s brightest shards, the oft-collaborating Maelstrom and LOUISAHHH are delighted to present the label RAAR. The name connotes both ‘rare, uncommon, unique’ and the sound of a guttural roar, the wild cry of a true passion project. Started as equal parts research division of techno’s new frontiers, haven for the sacred and profane, and ‘benevolent anarchy’, RAAR aims to release truly innovative work from and for brave sonic explorers. Invested in both shedding new light on techno legends and in exposing and uplifiting new talent, RAAR presents fresh work from illustrious figures in the genre and the work of newcomers and emerging artists. A techno label for punk rockers, a punk rock label for techno-heads, a celebration of the warrior spirit that feeds and inspires innovation and exploration, RAAR is born.
