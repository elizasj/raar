Two of techno’s brightest shards, the oft-collaborating Maelstrom and LOUISAHHH!!! are delighted to present the label RAAR.  The name connotes both ‘rare, uncommon, unique’ and the sound of a guttural roar, the wild cry of a true passion project.

Started as equal parts research division of techno’s new frontiers, haven for the sacred and profane, and ‘benevolent anarchy’, RAAR aims to release truly innovative music from and for brave sonic explorers.

The label encourages its audience to invest in and make use of what tools are laid out for the taking.

Invested in both shedding new light on techno legends and in exposing and uplifiting new talent, RAAR presents fresh work from illustrious figures in the genre and the work of newcomers and emerging artists:

RAAR001 celebrates a new collaboration in Roijacker, supergroup composed of  Dave Clarke, Black Asteroid and Mr Jones, in addition to LOUISAHHH!!! and Maelstrom’s own ongoing transition into raucous, full throttle rave warfare.

RAAR002 presents two emerging talents: Swiss-Italian Specialivery works ‘compulsive mental movement’ in both ambient and hypno-techno variations, mystery man Erson Rybod presents black midi for the dance floor.

With more to come….


A techno label for punk rockers, a punk rock label for techno-heads, a celebration of the warrior spirit that feeds and inspires innovation and exploration, RAAR is born.
