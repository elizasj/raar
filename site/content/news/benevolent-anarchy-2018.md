RAAR is pleased to present it's first club residency, BENEVOLENT ANARCHY, at GIBUS CLUB during the month of March, 2018.  

We have taken great pleasure in curating a lineup comprised of both fresh talent and legendary power in an effort to shake up normative club experiences and present something raw and different in both sound and feel.  

We hope that you will join us in our late night reverie, our boundary breaking, rule-disapproving, wild, joyful, benevolent anarchy.
